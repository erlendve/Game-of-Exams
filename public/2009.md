#oppg1

Consider the following Python code:  

    # !/usr/bin/env python
    import sys, random math
    def compute(n, f):
         i = 0; s = 0
         while i &lt;= n:
             s += f(random.random())
             i += 1
         return s/n
    n = sys.argv[1] 
    print 'The average of %d random function evalsis; % (n,\
    compute(n, math.sin))

There are five errors in this file - find them!');

#oppg2

Write a function that adds the current date to a filename. For example, calling
the function with the text `"myfile"` as argument results in the string
"myfile.2010_08_22" being returned if the current date is August 22, 2010. 
Hints: time, localtime, strftime, %d, %m, %Y.

#oppg3
You're a programmer at Foomatic Inc., where you've been assigned to retrieve
some data from the internets. Being an expert Python programmer, you soon
realize that you could write a script to do the job for you, while you go
skiing in the Norwegian mountains.
Use [__urllib__] [1] and [__HTMLParser__] [2] (see appendices) to implement a function for
retrieving data from the site
http://www.foobar.net/value_feed.html/

The data to be retrieved is in the following HTML format:

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <head>
            <title>Foobar valuable information</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="../default.css" type="text/css">Page 3
        </head>
        <body>
            <p class="valuable information">Sale on ham and eggs</p>
            <p class="valuable information">No more spam in stock</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    
Input to the function is the url-string: 
"http://www.foobar.net/value_feed.html"

The function should return a list containing the information in the paragraph
class named "valuable information", which in the example above would be:
["Sale on ham and eggs", "No more spam in stock"]
Hint: Make a subclass of HTMLParser, and add a class attribute  switch to set when you are
inside the correct paragraph.
